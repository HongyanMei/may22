abstract: Label-free and nondestructive mid-infrared vibrational hyperspectral imaging
  is an essential tissue analysis tool, providing spatially resolved biochemical information
  critical to understanding physiological and pathological processes. However, the
  chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and
  the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical
  performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, an advanced mid-infrared
  spectrochemical tissue imaging modality is introduced using metasurfaces that support
  strong surface-localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular
  maps of large-area murine brain tissue sections. The approach leverages polarization-multiplexed
  multi-resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect various functional
  biomolecules. The surface-enhanced mid-infrared spectral imaging method eliminates
  the non-specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on quantitative spectral analysis
  and improves chemical selectivity. This study shows that metasurface enhancement
  increases the retrieval of amide I and II bands associated with protein secondary
  structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated that plasmonic metasurfaces enhance the
  chemical contrast in infrared images and enable detection of ultrathin tissue regions
  that are not otherwise visible to conventional mid-infrared spectral imaging. While
  this work uses murine brain tissue sections, the chemical imaging method is well-suited
  for other tissue types, which broadens its potential impact for translational research
  and clinical histopathology.
