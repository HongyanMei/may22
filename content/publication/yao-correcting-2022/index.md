abstract: We found that temperature-dependent infrared spectroscopy measurements (i.e.,
  reflectance or transmittance) using a Fourier-transform spectrometer can have substantial
  errors, especially for elevated sample temperatures and collection using an objective
  lens. These errors can arise as a result of partial detector saturation due to thermal
  emission from the measured sample reaching the detector, resulting in nonphysical
  apparent reduction of reflectance or transmittance with increasing sample temperature.
  Here, we demonstrate that these temperature-dependent errors can be corrected by
  implementing several levels of optical attenuation that enable convergence testing
  of the measured reflectance or transmittance as the thermal-emission signal is reduced,
  or by applying correction factors that can be inferred by looking at the spectral
  regions where the sample is not expected to have a substantial temperature dependence.
