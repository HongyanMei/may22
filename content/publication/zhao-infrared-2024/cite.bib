 abstract = {Polarimetric infrared detection bolsters IR thermography by leveraging the polarization of light. Optical anisotropy, i.e., birefringence and dichroism, can be leveraged to achieve polarimetric detection. Recently, giant optical anisotropy was discovered in quasi-1D narrow-bandgap hexagonal perovskite sulfides, A1+xTiS3, specifically BaTiS3[1,2] and Sr9/8TiS3[3,4]. In these materials, the critical role of atomic-scale structure modulations[4,5] in the unconventional electrical[5,6], optical[7,8], and thermal[7,9] properties raises the broader question of other materials that belong to this family. To address this issue, for the first time, we synthesized high-quality single crystals of a largely unexplored member of the A1+xTiX3 (X = S, Se) family, BaTiSe3. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction determined the room-temperature structure with the P31c space group, which is a superstructure of the earlier reported[10] P63/mmc structure. The crystal structure of BaTiSe3 features antiparallel c-axis displacements similar to BaTiS3,[2] but is of lower symmetry. Polarization-resolved Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to characterize the optical anisotropy of BaTiSe3, whose refractive index along the ordinary (perpendicular to c) and extraordinary (parallel to c) optical axes was quantitatively determined by combining ellipsometry studies with FTIR. With a giant birefringence \\Delta\n~0.9, BaTiSe3 emerges as a new candidate for miniaturized birefringent optics for mid-wave infrared to long-wave infrared imaging.},
