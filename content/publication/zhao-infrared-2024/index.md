abstract: Polarimetric infrared detection bolsters IR thermography by leveraging the
  polarization of light. Optical anisotropy, i.e., birefringence and dichroism, can
  be leveraged to achieve polarimetric detection. Recently, giant optical anisotropy
  was discovered in quasi-1D narrow-bandgap hexagonal perovskite sulfides, A1+xTiS3,
  specifically BaTiS3[1,2] and Sr9/8TiS3[3,4]. In these materials, the critical role
  of atomic-scale structure modulations[4,5] in the unconventional electrical[5,6],
  optical[7,8], and thermal[7,9] properties raises the broader question of other materials
  that belong to this family. To address this issue, for the first time, we synthesized
  high-quality single crystals of a largely unexplored member of the A1+xTiX3 (X =
  S, Se) family, BaTiSe3. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction determined the room-temperature
  structure with the P31c space group, which is a superstructure of the earlier reported[10]
  P63/mmc structure. The crystal structure of BaTiSe3 features antiparallel c-axis
  displacements similar to BaTiS3,[2] but is of lower symmetry. Polarization-resolved
  Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to characterize
  the optical anisotropy of BaTiSe3, whose refractive index along the ordinary (perpendicular
  to c) and extraordinary (parallel to c) optical axes was quantitatively determined
  by combining ellipsometry studies with FTIR. With a giant birefringence Deltan~0.9,
  BaTiSe3 emerges as a new candidate for miniaturized birefringent optics for mid-wave
  infrared to long-wave infrared imaging.
