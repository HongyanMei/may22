 abstract = {Optical bottle beams can be used to trap atoms and small low-index particles. We introduce a figure of merit (FoM) for optical bottle beams, specifically in the context of optical traps, and use it to compare optical bottle-beam traps obtained by three different methods. Using this FoM and an optimization algorithm, we identified the optical bottle-beam traps based on a Gaussian beam illuminating a metasurface that are superior in terms of power efficiency than existing approaches. We numerically demonstrate a silicon metasurface for creating an optical bottle-beam trap.},
