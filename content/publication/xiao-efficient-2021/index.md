abstract: Optical bottle beams can be used to trap atoms and small low-index particles.
  We introduce a figure of merit (FoM) for optical bottle beams, specifically in the
  context of optical traps, and use it to compare optical bottle-beam traps obtained
  by three different methods. Using this FoM and an optimization algorithm, we identified
  the optical bottle-beam traps based on a Gaussian beam illuminating a metasurface
  that are superior in terms of power efficiency than existing approaches. We numerically
  demonstrate a silicon metasurface for creating an optical bottle-beam trap.
