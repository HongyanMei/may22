abstract: A challenge for optofluidic absorbance detection is the high concentration
  limit of detection due to the short optical path length. Herein, we introduce a
  concept of utilizing the coiled optical nanofiber for highly sensitive and robust
  optofluidic absorbance detection. Investigated by measuring the absorbance of FeCl3
  solutions, the sensor shows a detection limit down to 10 μM with excellent reversibility
  in a concentration range of 0–5 mM. The sensitivity is 10-fold higher than that
  of standard absorbance measurement by using a 1 cm cuvette. Also, highly sensitive
  chloramphenicol sensing was demonstrated by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent
  assay (ELISA) method, achieving a detection limit below 0.5 ng/L. The higher sensitivity
  and lower detection limit are caused by the large fractional power of evanescent
  field outside the nanofiber and the long detection length, which can effectively
  improve the absorption of the evanescent field, while the excellent reversibility
  is caused by the support of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pillar rather than by
  suspending the nanofiber in the microchannel. We envision that the present work
  may open up new opportunities for ultrasensitive chemical and biological sensing.
