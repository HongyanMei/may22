abstract: We demonstrate spatial modification of the optical properties of thin-film
  metal oxides, zinc oxide (ZnO) and vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ) as representatives,
  using a commercial focused ion beam (FIB) system. Using a Ga + FIB and thermal annealing,
  we demonstrated variable doping of a wide-bandgap semiconductor, ZnO, achieving
  carrier concentrations from 10 18  cm −3 to 10 20  cm −3 . Using the same FIB without
  subsequent thermal annealing, we defect-engineered a correlated semiconductor, VO
  2 , locally modifying its insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) temperature by up
  to ∼25 °C. Such area-selective modification of metal oxides by direct writing using
  a FIB provides a simple, mask-less route to the fabrication of optical structures,
  especially when multiple or continuous levels of doping or defect density are required.
