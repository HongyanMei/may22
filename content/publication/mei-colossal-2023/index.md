abstract: Materials with large birefringence (Δn, where n is the refractive index)
  are sought after for polarization control (e.g., in wave plates, polarizing beam
  splitters, etc.), nonlinear optics, micromanipulation, and as a platform for unconventional
  light–matter coupling, such as hyperbolic phonon polaritons. Layered 2D materials
  can feature some of the largest optical anisotropy; however, their use in most optical
  systems is limited because their optical axis is out of the plane of the layers
  and the layers are weakly attached. This work demonstrates that a bulk crystal with
  subtle periodic modulations in its structure—Sr9/8TiS3—is transparent and positive-uniaxial,
  with extraordinary index ne = 4.5 and ordinary index no = 2.4 in the mid- to far-infrared.
  The excess Sr, compared to stoichiometric SrTiS3, results in the formation of TiS6
  trigonal-prismatic units that break the chains of face-sharing TiS6 octahedra in
  SrTiS3 into periodic blocks of five TiS6 octahedral units. The additional electrons
  introduced by the excess Sr form highly oriented electron clouds, which selectively
  boost the extraordinary index ne and result in record birefringence (Δn textgreater
  2.1 with low loss). The connection between subtle structural modulations and large
  changes in refractive index suggests new categories of anisotropic materials and
  also tunable optical materials with large refractive-index modulation.
