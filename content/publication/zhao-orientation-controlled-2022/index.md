abstract: Low-dimensional materials with chain-like (one-dimensional) or layered (two-dimensional)
  structures are of significant interest due to their anisotropic electrical, optical,
  and thermal properties. One material with a chain-like structure, BaTiS3 (BTS),
  was recently shown to possess giant in-plane optical anisotropy and glass-like thermal
  conductivity. To understand the origin of these effects, it is necessary to fully
  characterize the optical, thermal, and electronic anisotropy of BTS. To this end,
  BTS crystals with different orientations (a- and c-axis orientations) were grown
  by chemical vapor transport. X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to characterize
  the local structure and electronic anisotropy of BTS. Fourier transform infrared
  reflection/transmission spectra show a large in-plane optical anisotropy in the
  a-oriented crystals, while the c-axis oriented crystals were nearly isotropic in-plane.
  BTS platelet crystals are promising uniaxial materials for infrared optics with
  their optic axis parallel to the c-axis. The thermal conductivity measurements revealed
  a thermal anisotropy of âˆ¼4.5 between the c- and a-axis. Time-domain Brillouin scattering
  showed that the longitudinal sound speed along the two axes is nearly the same,
  suggesting that the thermal anisotropy is a result of different phonon scattering
  rates.
