abstract: Heavy and hyper doping of ZnO by a combination of gallium (Ga) ion implantation
  using a focused ion beam (FIB) system and post-implantation laser annealing is demonstrated.
  Ion implantation allows for the incorporation of impurities with nearly arbitrary
  concentrations, and the laser-annealing process enables dopant activation close
  to or beyond the solid-solubility limit of Ga in ZnO. Heavily doped ZnO:Ga with
  free-carrier concentrations of ≈1021 cm−3, resulting in a plasma wavelength of 1.02
  μm, which is substantially shorter than the telecommunication wavelength of 1.55
  μm is demonstrated. Thus, this approach enables the control of the plasma frequency
  of ZnO from the far infrared down to 1.02 μm, thus, providing a promising plasmonic
  material for applications in this regime.
