abstract: Correlated disorder has been shown to enhance and modulate magnetic, electrical,
  dipolar, electrochemical and mechanical properties of materials. However, the possibility
  of obtaining novel optical and opto-electronic properties from such correlated disorder
  remains an open question. Here, we show unambiguous evidence of correlated disorder
  in the form of anisotropic, sub-angstrom-scale atomic displacements modulating the
  refractive index tensor and resulting in the giant optical anisotropy observed in
  BaTiS3, a quasi-one-dimensional hexagonal chalcogenide. Single crystal X-ray diffraction
  studies reveal the presence of antipolar displacements of Ti atoms within adjacent
  TiS6 chains along the c-axis, and three-fold degenerate Ti displacements in the
  a-b plane. 47/49Ti solid-state NMR provides additional evidence for those Ti displacements
  in the form of a three-horned NMR lineshape resulting from low symmetry local environment
  around Ti atoms. We used scanning transmission electron microscopy to directly observe
  the globally disordered Ti a-b plane displacements and find them to be ordered locally
  over a few unit cells. First-principles calculations show that the Ti a-b plane
  displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab-plane, while
  having minimal impact on the refractive index along the chain direction, thus resulting
  in a giant enhancement in the optical anisotropy. By showing a strong connection
  between correlated disorder and the optical response in BaTiS3, this study opens
  a pathway for designing optical materials with high refractive index and functionalities
  such as a large optical anisotropy and nonlinearity.
